Contributors: ulfben
Donate link: http://flattr.com/thing/367557/Support-my-WordPress-plugins
Tags: upload, organize, files, media
Requires at least: 3.9
Tested up to: 4.3
Stable tag: 3.4.2

Keeps your uploaded files organized in smart folder structures.

== Description ==
WordPress allow you to put uploads in year- and month-based folders. Custom Upload Dir is more flexible. You can construct paths from variables like post title, 
category, post author, post date [and many more](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/custom-upload-dir/screenshots/). 

I created Custom Upload Dir ensure my file system is always mirroring the site structure. This ensures I can always find files manually when needed. It also simplifies backups and platform migrations. 

[The screenshots might help explain](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/custom-upload-dir/screenshots/).

1. Customize your directory structure in `Settings -> Custom Upload Dir`

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How do I change base upload folder? =
Since WP 3.5, by a setting in wp-config.php:

`define('UPLOADS', WP_CONTENT_DIR.'/your-folder');`

Just be aware that this will likely break all paths to your previously uploaded stuff.

= How can I define my own tags? =
Use the `cud_generate_path`-filter, like so:

`function my_generate_path($template, $post_id){
	$my_tags = array('%tag1%','%tag2%');
	$replace = array($data, getData());
	$customdir = str_replace($tags,	$replace, $template);
	return $customdir;
}
add_filter('cud_generate_path', 'my_generate_path');`


== Screenshots ==

1. The configuration screen.
2. Shows how the upload path corresponds to the post's timestamp.
